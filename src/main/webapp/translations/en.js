A brief overview can be found in the ORDS documentation at  http:\/\/help.it.ox.ac.uk\/research\/ords\/howto07#Querying-using-sql, and W3schools.com offers a helpful SQL tutorial at http:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/sql. \n\nIf you would like to save a copy of the results of your query, you can export the results as a CSV file.
