#. Source text: This page will allow you to construct database queries using SQL. 
#. Type each clause of the SQL statement into the appropriate field below. 
#. 
#. There's no need to enter the SQL command that appears immediately before the field (e.g. SELECT, FROM, etc.): the ORDS will supply this automatically (and will delete it if it is entered). 
#. 
#. Pre-written SQL queries can be pasted into the SELECT field: the ORDS will divide the query into its component parts and distribute it appropriately. 
#. 
#. You can also simply start typing a complete SQL statement in the SELECT field: if the ORDS detects that you have entered a command that belongs in another field, it will move you there automatically. 
#. 
#. If you would like to learn more about how to construct SQL queries, there are plenty of books and online guides available. A brief overview can be found in the ORDS documentation at  http://help.it.ox.ac.uk/research/ords/howto07#Querying-using-sql, and W3schools.com offers a helpful SQL tutorial at http://www.w3schools.com/sql. 
#. 
#. If you would like to save a copy of the results of your query, you can export the results as a CSV file. For full projects, project owners, administrators, and contributors can also save the results as an ORDS dataset.
