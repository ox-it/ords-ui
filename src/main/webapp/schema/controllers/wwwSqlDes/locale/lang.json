There's no need to enter the SQL command that appears immediately before the field (e.g. SELECT, FROM, etc.): the ORDS will supply this automatically (and will delete it if it is entered). \n\n Pre-written SQL queries can be pasted into the SELECT field: the ORDS will divide the query into its component parts and distribute it appropriately. You can also simply start typing a complete SQL statement in the SELECT field: if the ORDS detects that you have entered a command that belongs in another field, it will move you there automatically. \n\n If you would like to learn more about how to construct SQL queries, there are plenty of books and online guides available. A brief overview can be found in the <a href=\"http://help.it.ox.ac.uk/research/ords/howto07#Querying-using-sql\" target=\"_blank\">ORDS documentation<\/a>, and W3schools.com offers a helpful <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/sql/\" target=\"_blank\">SQL tutorial<\/a>. \n\n If you would like to save a copy of the results of your query, you can export the results as a CSV file.
